# Prognostic AI-monitoring

This repository contains the code of our research on prognostic AI-monitoring: a prototype for automatic response evaluation to treatment of cancer patients with advanced disease based on deep learning image-to-image registration. 

:construction: This research is still in its preliminary phase, further development and validation is warrant before clinical use.
